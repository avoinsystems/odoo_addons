Performance Analyzer
====================

Features
--------

This module log in function of logging rules:
* each JSON-RPC / XML-RPC call linked to a model:
  db, datetime, model, method, user, total time, db time, args, result
* Python method profiling
* SQL queries stats

A logging rule is defined directly via the user interface
(menu: Settings > Technical > Performance > Rules)
and it's applied without restarting Odoo server.

To hide the database *_perf created at installation,
add "dbfilter = (?!.*_perf$)" in your config file.
